This repository contains a template of the application that reads 
The Complete Works of William Shakespeare from a text file into a Stream<String>

2. In WordCount class,
 implement main method such that it will output the list containing:

word
number of times the word is used in the Complete Works of Shakespeare
The list must be ordered from most used to least used, an example:

the        23245
I        20245
and        18575
to        15809
of        15700
a        12535
you        11952
my        10828
IMPORTANT HINTS

1. Use line.split("[()\"!?,;.\\s]+") to split the line into words, 
taking into accout punctuation symbols

2. Use groupingBy(..) collector with counting() downstream collector
 to get the map of word to word count.

3. Convert the map to stream and sort this stream by map
 values using sorted method and providing a Comparator.
